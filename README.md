JavaScript
==========

Random odds and end of ECMAScript of ACNEScript as I like to call it... LOL. I never call it that.



GLOBALS
-------------

This is a bucket for all the little global modules for doing little general tasks... obviously all in individual scripts to make sure any app using them magically turns your browser into a fatty running up an incline. Use responsibly. Concatinate and minimise.


USER SCRIPTS
----------------

Make your browser much much much better at all sorts of ludikriz things. Or worse at just general things. Please see:

And install ALL of them.
