JavaScript
==========

Random odds and end of ECMAScript of ACNEScript as I like to call it... LOL. I never call it that.



Glbals
-------------

This is a bucket for all the little global modules for doing little general tasks... obviously all in individual scripts to make sure any app using them magically turns your browser into a fatty running up an incline. Use responsibly. Concatinate and minimise.


User Scripts
----------------

Make your browser much much much better at all sorts of ludikriz things. Or worse at just general things. Please see:

And install ALL of them.


Clock
----------------

A clock using Kinetic JS... I posted a blog about it at http://jasonds.co.uk/blog/analog-clock-kinetic.


Planets
----------------

A simple parallax experiment (only looks great on a pretty hi-res screen, sorry), it's not very refined. Will be scrubbing it up and posting to blog soon.


SpotifyClone
----------------

Some pretty SPA scaffold, typescript, angular, bower, travis, grunt, jasmine, karma... the usual offenders. But a brave new world for a dev that has spend a few years pushing his way up the OSI stack.
